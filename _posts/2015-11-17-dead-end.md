Sometimes it happens when you seem to have hit a dead end when doing an exercise or task. You have no idea what to do next and although all previous tests pass you're not even sure how or why? Basically, your brain shuts off completely. In my case, it usually happens when I over-think the task and make it too complicated in my head. 

In situations like this it's usually recommended to take time off and do something else - read a newspaper or something like this. But I've found that taking time off is usually just a waste of time - as soon as I get back to work I start off where I left, which means everything is still messed up in my head regarding the code.

But there is a trick, which (at least for me) works way better. Leave the thing you are stuck with and take up exercise you know you can do quite easily and do it. After that try going back to the exercise or task, you were stuck with. Doing easier exercise seems to somehow restart one's brain and logical thinking. I think that's a completely psychological thing because you try to convince your mind that you are actually able to do at least something instead of being a complete idiot, which it has led to believe to be in last few hours.
