Elixir is the first language I am learning during my apprenticeship so I’ll try to keep an updated list of the resources I’ve found useful for learning Elixir. Hopefully it’ll make someone else’s life little bit easier.


<h4>Websites:</h4>

1. [Elixir Documentation][docs] - probably won’t need an explanation why it’s useful. 

2. [Elixir Cheatsheet][cheat_sheet] - I’ve found it great for looking up syntax quickly. 

3. [Elixir Style Guide][style_guide] - yet again the name is quite self-explanatory. Look up how to style your code. 

4. [Etudes for Elixir][etudes] - online book with many small exercises to complement the Introducing Elixir book. 

<h4>Books:</h4>

1. [Introducing Elixir][introducing_elixir] (Simon St. Laurent, J. David Eisenberg) -  I think it’s quite good book for beginners, because it doesn’t require a lot of previous knowledge. It starts from very basic stuff and goes step-by-step to more complicated concepts. I would recommend following the examples and actually doing them at the same time on your computer, to practice the language and not to get lost.



<h4>Others:</h4>

1. Unfortunately can’t bring out any good examples yet, but  hopefully I can add some useful videos, courses and so on here soon.
