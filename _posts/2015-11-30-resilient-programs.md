Since today, I had done exercises, which included communicating with easy and well working external API-s. But today we had a workshop for resilient programs, which could handle different errors coming from external services and survive while handling them. I realised that I do not have sufficient skills to handle different errors and clearly should work on this in near future. It's nice when things work for happy scenarios, but it's crucial for them to handle the worst-case scenarios as well.
